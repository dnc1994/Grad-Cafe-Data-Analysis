[Grad Cafe](https://thegradcafe.com/) is an active graduate school discussion forum used mostly by applicants of universities in North America. Over the years it has accumulated a large amount of data that could be valuable to graduate school applicants. In this project, we will go through the complete process of web scraping, data parsing & cleaning, exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.
